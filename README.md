# lab-django-wiki

We will build a basic wiki in Django.

#### Base Requirements: 

* All pages should provide a Navigation Bar that allows a user to go 'Home', 'Add a New Entry', or 'Your Entries', as well as 'Login/Logout/New User' depending on if the User is registered and signed in or not. 

* 'Add a new Entry' and list 'Your Entries' should only be available if the User is signed in. The main 'index' page should list all current Wiki entries from all Authors along with their main image (if present)

* All Users should be able to click the Title of an individual entry to see the full post. If the post has an image, it should display. 

* If a displayed entry is also owned by the current signed in User, you should offer them options to 'Edit and/or 'Delete' the entry.
